##PDO Function for PHP##
This function allows users in PHP to interface with mySQL databases using the PDO library which has the benefit of allowing prepared statements to avoid the potential exploit of a sql injection attack. This is particularly useful when running frontend web applications. 

###Sample Use###
Select statememnt returned in an associative array. One value is then echoed. 
```
$return = sqlQuery($connection, "SELECT * FROM my_users;");
echo $return[0]['username']
```
Select statement returns an associative array with one argument. All results are then printed out.
```
$returntwo = sqlQuery($connection, "SELECT * FROM prepared WHERE name = ?;", array("nick"));
foreach ($returntwo as $key => $value) {
	echo $value['age']."<br />";
}
```
Insert statement does not return any useful data, it is just executed. In this example there are multiple arguments.
```
sqlQuery($connection, "INSERT INTO prepared (name,age) VALUES (?,?)", array("Jane", 18));
```

###Installation###
1. Download sqlQuery.php and place it in your project directory.
2. Require the file in your project.
```
require_once("sqlQuery.php");
```
3. Use as directed above.
